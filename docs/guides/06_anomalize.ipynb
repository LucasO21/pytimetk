        "Anomaly detection in time series analysis is a crucial process for identifying unusual patterns that deviate from expected behavior. These anomalies can signify critical, often unforeseen events in time series data. Effective anomaly detection helps in maintaining the quality and reliability of data, ensuring accurate forecasting and decision-making. The challenge lies in distinguishing between true anomalies and natural fluctuations, which demands sophisticated analytical techniques and a deep understanding of the underlying time series patterns. As a result, anomaly detection is an essential component of time series analysis, driving the proactive management of risks and opportunities in dynamic environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pytimetk uses the following methods to determine anomalies in time series data;\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Decomposition of Time Series:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The first step is to decompose the time series into several components. Commonly, this includes **trend**, **seasonality**, and **remainder** (or residual) components.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Trend represents the underlying pattern or direction in the data over time.\n",
        "\tSeasonality captures recurring patterns or cycles over a specific period, such as daily, weekly, monthly, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The remainder (or residual) is what's left after the trend and seasonal components have been removed from the original time series.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Generating Remainders:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * After decomposition, the remainder component is extracted. This component reflects the part of the time series that cannot be explained by the trend and seasonal components.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The idea is that while trend and seasonality represent predictable and thus \"normal\" patterns, the remainder is where anomalies are most likely to manifest.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 2 common techniques for seasonal decomposition; STL and Twitter;\n",
        "\n",
        "* **STL** (Seasonal and Trend Decomposition) is a versatile and robust method for decomposing time series. STL works very well in circumstances where a long term trend is present. The Loess algorithm typically does a very good job at detecting the trend. However, it circumstances when the seasonal component is more dominant than the trend, Twitter tends to perform better.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Twitter** method is a similar decomposition method to that used in Twitter’s AnomalyDetection package. The Twitter method works identically to STL for removing the seasonal component. The main difference is in removing the trend, which is performed by removing the median of the data rather than fitting a smoother. The median works well when a long-term trend is less dominant that the short-term seasonal component. This is because the smoother tends to overfit the anomalies.\n",
